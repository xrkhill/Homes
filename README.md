# What is this?

I'd dabbled with Rails at work and wanted to write something without
following a tutorial. This was my attempt to solve one of my own
problems with a simple web app. I was shopping for a home at the time,
and wanted something to track all the properties we'd visited and what
we thought of them. This is the result. The code wasn't great, but the
experience got me excited about using Ruby and Rails. I used what I
learned to help me convince others at my job to learn more.
